    <h1>Interaction Design Analysis</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-top: -10px">Jannalyn Tan - s4056775</h2>
    <p>
      Both Holdspace (Carlos Yusim) and Inter-symmetric – NNNB (Fell & Treanor)
      are single-page experiences, but they approach interaction very
      differently, one more linear and guided, the other is experimental and
      hands-on. This contrast is clear when comparing how they handle
      information design, mapping, characterisation, and feedback.

        <p class="text hidden" id="infoHoldText">
          Holdspace is simple and clean. There’s hardly any text, and the
          visuals are very minimal. Using simple text to show users how to
          interact with the experience. It has a lot of negative space which
          helps focus your attention on the sound and the shape pulses along
          with it. Everything is stripped back so you can just take in the
          experience of the sound piece. Another point is the use of inverse
          colours, which help the user identify whether the sound is active or
          not. Overall, the design of Holdspace is kept minimal and clean,
          allowing users to fully focus on the sound rather than the design of
          the site.

        <button class="interBtn" id="infoInterBtn">click to reveal</button>
        <p class="text hidden" id="infoInterText">
          On the other hand, Inter-symmetric mimics hardware synths likely to
          tap into users’ prior experience and encourage playful
          experimentation. The lack of labels supports an intuitive,
          discovery-driven engagement rather than step-by-step instruction. Its
          blue colour scheme adds some visual interest while keeping things
          minimal and clean. There’s no written explanation, but if you’ve seen
          or used a synth before, the design almost explains itself through
          familiarity and layout.

        <p class="text hidden" id="mapHoldText">
          Holdspace is super straightforward. You just hold down the main button
          and the sound plays. The mapping is very direct, one action, one
          result. This keeps the interaction lightweight and keeps the user
          focused on the sound piece rather than controlling it. The simplicity
          reinforces the idea that this is something to experience, not to
          create with.

        <p class="text hidden" id="mapInterText">
          Inter-symmetric is way more open. It doesn’t tell you what to do, but
          that’s part of the fun. The mapping is designed to reflect real-life
          hardware synths, so users are encouraged to explore by clicking,
          dragging, or hovering over different controls. It allows for play and
          creation. There’s no single “correct” path, it’s all about
          experimenting.

          In the end, both UIs succeed on their own terms, Holdspace invites
          quiet observation, a linear and guided experience. Having the user
          enjoy and listen to the sound piece. While Inter-symmetric pushes for
          playful interaction. It is a non-linear experience having users play
          and creative using the foundation sound layer of what the website
          already has.
