    <h1>Interaction Design Analysis</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-top: -10px">Jannalyn Tan - s4056775</h2>
    <p>
      Both Holdspace (Carlos Yusim) and Inter-symmetric – NNNB (Fell & Treanor)
      are single-page experiences, but they approach interaction very
      differently, one more linear and guided, the other is experimental and
      hands-on. This contrast is clear when comparing how they handle
      information design, mapping, characterisation, and feedback.

        <p class="text hidden" id="infoHoldText">
          Holdspace is simple and clean. There’s hardly any text, and the
          visuals are very minimal. Using simple text to show users how to
          interact with the experience. Having the text fade away after users
          learn about the interaction. Allowing user to fully focus on the
          visual and sound. Everything is stripped back so you can just take in
          the experience of the sound piece, having the visual accompany the
          sound. Overall, the design of Holdspace is kept minimal and clean,
          allowing users to fully focus on the sound rather than the design of
          the site.

        <p class="text hidden" id="infoInterText">
          On the other hand, Inter-symmetric mimics hardware synths likely to
          tap into users’ prior experience and encourage playful
          experimentation. The lack of instructions supports an intuitive,
          discovery-driven engagement rather than step-by-step instruction. Even
          though there is a lot of elements placed on the website, there is
          still a structure to it, like a physical synth.

          <br />
          <br />
          Sectioning it based on the sound, pitch and length. Having there be
          some label to give more information on how to use the digital synth.
          From on and off buttons to the different numbers on the button to
          educate users, giving them more information about what each buttons
          do. This all helping the website not give any instruction about how to
          interact with the website, different from Holdspace allowing users to
          play and explore based on familiarity and layout of a physical synth.

              The mapping in Holdspace is straightforward and simple.
              Instructions appear as text; pressing and holding the main button
              triggers the sound. This direct mapping, one action leading to one
              result, keeping interactions lightweight and allows users to
              concentrate on the sound piece rather than the controls. The
              simplicity reinforces the idea that the experience is meant to be
              enjoyed, not manipulated.

            <p style="font-family: Open Sans, sans-serif">
              On the other hand, Inter-symmetric is open-ended. It does not
              dictate actions, which adds to the enjoyment. The mapping mimics
              real-life hardware synthesizers, prompting users to explore
              through clicking, dragging, or hovering over various controls.
              Each element interacts similarly to a real synth. Users apply
              their prior knowledge about sliders and knobs, with labels
              assisting their understanding of how to interact with the site.
              Each interaction alters the sound in real time, promoting
              experimentation and creativity. There is no singular “correct” way
              to interact; the focus is on exploration.

          Holdspace uses minimal elements and text. The monochromatic colour
          scheme and minimal geometric shapes all contribute to its view of it
          being more of a listening and viewing experience rather than a
          experimental. Having it be black and white helps to focus the viewers'
          attention to the sound piece instead of getting distracted. Using a
          geometric shape adds on to the experience making it seem more
          futuristic adding to the website making it seem more innovative.
          Showcasing this creative soundpiece that the designer has created.
          <br />
          <br />
          It has a lot of negative space which helps focus your attention on the
          sound and the shape pulses along with it. Overall, the way it looks
          and the use of negative space supports the idea that Holdspace is not
          a tool or instrument, but a showcase of a sound piece. Meaning to
          experience it and not create with it.

          By contrast, Inter-symmetric characterises itself as a tool for
          creation. It puts the user in the role of a sound designer, inviting
          you to tweak, experiment, and build your own soundscape. The interface
          visually is more complex compared to Holdspace, filled with sliders,
          knobs, and buttons that mimic a physical synthesizer. This complexity
          gives it a sense of depth and realism. Allowing users to connect that
          this is a digital replicate of physical synthesiser.

          <br /><br />
          Another feature that helps users understand how to interact with the
          website is the use of different words used, like ‘sound’, ‘pitch’,
          ‘length’ which gives users a hint about what the website it about.
          Finally, based on Plutchik colour wheel, using the blue invokes the
          emotion of surprise. Having users to explore and create their own
          sound piece. It’s a playful interface, giving the user the feeling of
          control, creativity, and technical engagement. While Holdspace invites
          viewing and admiration, Inter-symmetric invites interaction.

          Holdspace uses visual feedback when loading the sound and interaction.
          Increasing the percentage till 100% till the screen is completely
          loaded up. Having this is great as it allows the sounds and visual to
          be fully loaded before allowing access to the site. Another feedback
          is the use of inverse colours, which help the user identify whether
          the sound is active or not. The final feedback is the use of the
          progress bar at the top of the screen. This bar allowed users to know
          how long more of the sound piece they had left, encoruaging them to
          finish the sound piece.

          Inter-symmetric uses more traditional UI feedback, sliders move, dials
          turn, sounds shift, giving you that satisfying sense of control and
          response as you interact. It indictates state changes via hovers
          colour changes and the change of the cursor. These indicators allow
          users to identify whether the elements can be adjusted. As for the
          dials, the number change at the bottom of it informs the users that
          they have adjusted the dial, giving them the sense of acknowledgement
          that their actions were completed.

          In the end, both UIs succeed on their own terms, Holdspace invites
          quiet observation, a linear and guided experience. Having the user
          enjoy and listen to the sound piece. While Inter-symmetric pushes for
          playful interaction. It is a non-linear experience having users play
          and creative using the foundation sound layer of what the website
          already has. Their designs reflect very different ideas about what it
          means to “experience” sound.
