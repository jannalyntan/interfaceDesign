      <h1 id="designValues">Design Values</h1>
      <p>
        While creating my website, I focused on several key design values to
        ensure the experience would be engaging, intuitive, and enjoyable.
      </p>

      <div class="sidebyside2">
        <div class="background">
          <h2 style="color: white">1. Immersive Design</h2>
          <p>
            Each key press triggers a corresponding note, allowing users to
            immerse themselves in a sensory interaction that blends text and
            sound.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="background">
          <h2 style="color: white">2. Playful Design</h2>
          <p>
            When users press “Play,” the interface sequentially plays back the
            letters they typed, turning their words into a playful audio
            sequence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="background">
          <h2 style="color: white">3. Learnability</h2>
          <p>
            The current character being played is highlighted in real time,
            helping users follow along and understand the interaction without
            extra instructions.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="sidebyside" style="margin-top: 100px">
        <div class="left">
          <h2>1. Immersive Design</h2>
          <p style="margin-left: -1px">
            To achieve immersion, I focused on creating variety and
            unpredictability within the interface. For example, the ripple
            animations are randomized, so each interaction feels slightly
            different and keeps users engaged for longer. This unpredictability
            encourages repeated exploration and maintains interest over time.
            <br /><br />
            Letter-by-letter feedback during playback also contributed to
            immersion. Highlighting each character allowed users to track their
            progress, reinforcing engagement and a sense of ownership. Since the
            user’s words and reflections are translated into sound, this design
            element made the experience feel personal and interactive, enhancing
            the sense of being the creator of the experience. Having a stronger
            sense of connection and immersion to the experience.

            The website encourages creativity by letting users turn words and
            reflections into sound. The experience is non-linear, there’s no
            single “correct” way to interact. Even with a limited set of
            buttons, the vast possibilities of language input allow for infinite
            variations. This playful structure invites experimentation and keeps
            the experience fresh and engaging.

      <h2 style="margin-top: 100px">3. Learnability</h2>
      <p style="color: black">
        I aimed for a clean and minimal interface to make the system easy to
        learn and navigate. Immediate audio feedback on typing introduces users
        to the concept naturally. Giving an insight to what the website might be
        about.

            learn what the next possible ‘step’ is.

        <div class="colouredBg">
          <p style="color: black">
            With only three clearly labelled buttons (Play, Reset, Generate),
            users can easily experiment with the interface and learn its
            functions through exploration. This simplicity ensures that both
            first-time and returning users can quickly feel comfortable and
            confident interacting with the UI.

      <h1 id="techCon">UI Design</h1>

      <div class="backgroundcolour">
        <h2>Information Design</h2>

        <div class="sidebyside" style="margin-top: 100px">
          <div class="left">
            <h3>Layout</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: -1px">
              The minimal layout not only creates a calming atmosphere but also
              makes navigation intuitive. The placeholder phrase acts as a
              subtle starting point, inviting users to begin interacting. The
              textbox, positioned prominently as the largest element on the
              screen, naturally draws attention as the primary input area.
              <br /><br />
              Above the textbox, the Generate button offers users an easy way to
              receive a prompt if they’re unsure what to write, supporting
              different levels of engagement. The Play and Reset buttons are
              placed at the bottom of the interface to signal the end of the
              interaction, reinforcing a clear, top-to-bottom flow from input to
              output. This deliberate spatial hierarchy ensures that users can
              understand the interaction sequence at a glance.

          <div class="right">
            <h3>Focus Mode</h3>
            <p style="margin-right: -1px">
              In addition to layout, Focus Mode provides dynamic visual feedback
              to guide users through interaction. Instead of using explicit
              instructions, the design employs subtle visual cues, for example,
              when users type into the textbox, the Play button becomes
              highlighted. This state change signals the next logical action,
              encouraging progression without additional text.
              <br /><br />
              Together, these two methods establish a clear and intuitive
              interaction flow. They support learnability, reduce cognitive
              load, and invite users to explore the interface confidently, even
              on their first visit.

          <h2>Mapping</h2>
          <p style="margin-left: -1px">
            Since the main theme of the project is Novel Input, I designed the
            interface to encourage exploration rather than following strict
            instructions. Users type a phrase or reflection, making the
            experience interactive and non-linear.
            <br /><br />
            Using a simple textbox leverages a familiar interface pattern,
            allowing users to understand immediately what action is required.
            Each keystroke maps naturally to a corresponding sound, creating a
            cause-and-effect relationship that reinforces the interaction and
            supports creativity. This mapping ensures that users feel in control
            while exploring the system’s possibilities.

          <h2>Characterisation</h2>
          <p style="margin-right: -1px">
            The website intentionally embodies a Zen and calming style to match
            the auditory experience. Green is the primary colour, while elements
            are rounded and simple, creating a soft and approachable visual
            language. Subtle textures and the brushstroke-inspired ripple
            animations add layers to the design, reinforcing the meditative
            quality of the interaction. This consistent characterisation helps
            set user expectations, provides context for the interactions, and
            aligns the visual style with the sound, enhancing the immersive
            experience.

              The letter-by-letter highlighting during playback provides another
              layer of feedback, helping users track the current position in
              their typed phrase. This reinforces engagement and ownership, as
              users can follow the progression of their own words being “played”
              in real time.

              Additional feedback cues include button hover states, which change
              the cursor and slightly adjust the button size, signalling
              interactivity and ensuring users know which elements are
              actionable. These feedback mechanisms, both visual and auditory,

      <h1 id="techCon">Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        Since the progress milestone presentation, there haven’t been any major
        conceptual changes to the overall design. The core idea and aesthetic
        stayed the same, but I made a series of smaller design tweaks and
        interactive additions to build out the experience more fully. Most of
        these changes came from user feedback during testing and from noticing
        areas that felt underdeveloped when I revisited the prototype. My main
        focus was on improving clarity, usability, and making the experience
        feel more immersive.
      </p>

      <section class="backgroundcolour" style="margin-top: 100px">
        <h2>Feedback Changes</h2>
        <div class="sidebyside">
          <div class="left">
            <p style="margin-left: -1px">
              One of the most significant changes came from how users interacted
              with the buttons. Initially, my buttons didn’t follow typical UI
              conventions, they didn’t have a border or background, just styled
              text. I assumed users would still recognise them because the
              interface was clean and minimal, but during testing, many
              completely missed them. They thought the text was decorative
              rather than clickable, which wasn’t what I intended at all.

              <br /><br />
              Reflecting on this, I realised I’d prioritised the aesthetic side
              too much without considering how users actually interpret visual
              cues. To fix this, I added a slight background to the buttons,
              while keeping the hover interactions (growing slightly and
              changing cursor). This small tweak made a big difference, users
              started noticing the buttons immediately, and the flow through the
              site became much smoother. It was a good reminder that sometimes
              simple, conventional patterns help support the experience rather
              than take away from it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <img src="images/Textbox.png" alt="code-1" style="width: 750px" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sidebyside" style="margin-top: 100px">
          <div class="left">
            <img
              src="images/highlight-feature.png"
              alt="code-1"
              style="height: 400px"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <p style="margin-right: -1px">
              Another small but meaningful change I made was updating the
              placeholder text from “type here” to “reflect on what makes you
              calm.” This shift aligned the interface more closely with the
              overall concept and tone of the website, while also addressing
              user feedback. During testing, some users mentioned they weren’t
              sure what to type, so adding this prompt gave them a gentle
              starting point. It not only guided their interaction but also set
              the emotional context of the experience right from the beginning.

        </div>
      </section>

      <h2>Ripple Animation</h2>
      <p>
        Another major addition was the ripple animation that appears when the
        audio plays. Initially, when the sound played, the interface felt too
        static, with the only change was the text being highlighted. I wanted
        the audio interaction to feel more alive and reflective of the project’s
        calm, zen-inspired theme. This so helped to enhancing overall user
        experience using the website. Making the website not only more immersive
        but more fun overall.
      </p>
      <div class="sidebyside">
        <div class="left">
          <p style="margin-left: -1px">
            While creating this website I always thought that the sound itself
            reminded me of wind chimes and water drums, which led to the idea of
            mimicking a droplet hitting water. By adding ripples that expand and
            slowly fade away, I created a visual element that worked alongside
            the sound, turning the moment into both an audio and visual
            experience.

          />
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p style="margin-right: -1px">
            Getting this right wasn’t easy. I went through multiple rounds of
            testing to nail the timing and randomness. I used CSS animations
            triggered through JavaScript and added &lt;math.random&gt; so the
            animations wouldn’t feel too repetitive, making it more like real
            water droplets. It took time to balance the speed, size, and
            fade-out so it didn’t feel too artificial. But once it clicked, it
            really brought the interaction to life and made the whole experience
            feel more complete and immersive.

            Since the main theme of the project is Novel Input, I designed the
            interface to encourage exploration rather than following strict
            instructions. Users type a phrase or reflection, making the
            experience interactive and non-linear.
            <br /><br />
            Using a simple textbox leverages a familiar interface pattern,
            allowing users to understand immediately what action is required.
            Each keystroke maps naturally to a corresponding sound, creating a
            cause-and-effect relationship that reinforces the interaction and
            supports creativity. This mapping ensures that users feel in control
            while exploring the system’s possibilities.
