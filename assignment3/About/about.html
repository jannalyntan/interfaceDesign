      <p>
        While creating my website, I focused on several key design values to
        ensure the experience would be engaging, intuitive, and enjoyable.
      </p>

      <div class="sidebyside2">
        <div class="background">
          <h2 style="color: white">1. Immersive Design</h2>
          <p>
            Each key press triggers a corresponding note, allowing users to
            immerse themselves in a sensory interaction that blends text and
            sound.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="background">
          <h2 style="color: white">2. Playful Design</h2>
          <p>
            When users press “Play,” the interface sequentially plays back the
            letters they typed, turning their words into a playful audio
            sequence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="background">
          <h2 style="color: white">3. Learnability</h2>
          <p>
            The current character being played is highlighted in real time,
            helping users follow along and understand the interaction without
            extra instructions.

          <h2>1. Immersive Design</h2>
          <p style="margin-left: -1px">
            To achieve immersion, I focused on creating variety and
            unpredictability within the interface. For example, the ripple
            animations are randomized, so each interaction feels slightly
            different and keeps users engaged for longer. This unpredictability
            encourages repeated exploration and maintains interest over time.
            <br /><br />
            Letter-by-letter feedback during playback also contributed to
            immersion. Highlighting each character allowed users to track their
            progress, reinforcing engagement and a sense of ownership. Since the
            user’s words and reflections are translated into sound, this design
            element made the experience feel personal and interactive, enhancing
            the sense of being the creator of the experience. Having a stronger
            sense of connection and immersion to the experience.

            The website encourages creativity by letting users turn words and
            reflections into sound. The experience is non-linear, there’s no
            single “correct” way to interact. Even with a limited set of
            buttons, the vast possibilities of language input allow for infinite
            variations. This playful structure invites experimentation and keeps
            the experience fresh and engaging.

      <h2 style="margin-top: 100px">3. Learnability</h2>
      <p style="color: black">
        I aimed for a clean and minimal interface to make the system easy to
        learn and navigate. Immediate audio feedback on typing introduces users
        to the concept naturally. Giving an insight to what the website might be
        about.

            first-time and returning users can quickly feel comfortable and
            confident interacting with the UI.

            <h3>Layout</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: -1px">
              The minimal layout not only creates a calming atmosphere but also
              makes navigation intuitive. The placeholder phrase acts as a
              subtle starting point, inviting users to begin interacting. The
              textbox, positioned prominently as the largest element on the
              screen, naturally draws attention as the primary input area.
              <br /><br />
              Above the textbox, the Generate button offers users an easy way to
              receive a prompt if they’re unsure what to write, supporting
              different levels of engagement. The Play and Reset buttons are
              placed at the bottom of the interface to signal the end of the
              interaction, reinforcing a clear, top-to-bottom flow from input to
              output. This deliberate spatial hierarchy ensures that users can
              understand the interaction sequence at a glance.

            <h3>Focus Mode</h3>
            <p style="margin-right: -1px">
              In addition to layout, Focus Mode provides dynamic visual feedback
              to guide users through interaction. Instead of using explicit
              instructions, the design employs subtle visual cues, for example,
              when users type into the textbox, the Play button becomes
              highlighted. This state change signals the next logical action,
              encouraging progression without additional text.
              <br /><br />
              Together, these two methods establish a clear and intuitive
              interaction flow. They support learnability, reduce cognitive
              load, and invite users to explore the interface confidently, even
              on their first visit.

            Since the main theme of the project is Novel Input, I designed the
            interface to encourage exploration rather than following strict
            instructions. Users type a phrase or reflection, making the
            experience interactive and non-linear.
            <br /><br />
            Using a simple textbox leverages a familiar interface pattern,
            allowing users to understand immediately what action is required.
            Each keystroke maps naturally to a corresponding sound, creating a
            cause-and-effect relationship that reinforces the interaction and
            supports creativity. This mapping ensures that users feel in control
            while exploring the system’s possibilities.

            The website intentionally embodies a Zen and calming style to match
            the auditory experience. Green is the primary colour, while elements
            are rounded and simple, creating a soft and approachable visual
            language. Subtle textures and the brushstroke-inspired ripple
            animations add layers to the design, reinforcing the meditative
            quality of the interaction. This consistent characterisation helps
            set user expectations, provides context for the interactions, and
            aligns the visual style with the sound, enhancing the immersive
            experience.

              their typed phrase. This reinforces engagement and ownership, as
              users can follow the progression of their own words being “played”
              in real time.

      <h1 id="designProcessCon">Design Process</h1>

      <p>
        Since the progress milestone presentation, there haven’t been any major
        conceptual changes to the overall design. The core idea and aesthetic
        stayed the same, but I made a series of smaller design tweaks and
        interactive additions to build out the experience more fully. Most of
        these changes came from user feedback during testing and from noticing
        areas that felt underdeveloped when I revisited the prototype. My main
        focus was on improving clarity, usability, and making the experience
        feel more immersive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is 3 main things I changed between the previous user testing and
        now.
      </p>

      <div class="sidebyside">
        <div class="background1">
          <h2 style="color: white">Feedback Changes</h2>

            navigate.

        </div>
      </div>

      <section class="backgroundcolour" style="margin-top: 100px">
        <h2>Feedback Changes</h2>
        <div class="sidebyside">
          <div class="left">
            <p style="margin-left: -1px">
              One of the most significant changes came from how users interacted
              with the buttons. Initially, my buttons didn’t follow typical UI
              conventions, they didn’t have a border or background, just styled
              text. I assumed users would still recognise them because the
              interface was clean and minimal, but during testing, many
              completely missed them. They thought the text was decorative
              rather than clickable, which wasn’t what I intended at all.

              <br /><br />
              Reflecting on this, I realised I’d prioritised the aesthetic side
              too much without considering how users actually interpret visual
              cues. To fix this, I added a slight background to the buttons,
              while keeping the hover interactions (growing slightly and
              changing cursor). This small tweak made a big difference, users
              started noticing the buttons immediately, and the flow through the
              site became much smoother. It was a good reminder that sometimes
              simple, conventional patterns help support the experience rather
              than take away from it.

          <div class="right">
            <p style="margin-right: -1px">
              Another small but meaningful change I made was updating the
              placeholder text from “type here” to “reflect on what makes you
              calm.” This shift aligned the interface more closely with the
              overall concept and tone of the website, while also addressing
              user feedback. During testing, some users mentioned they weren’t
              sure what to type, so adding this prompt gave them a gentle
              starting point. It not only guided their interaction but also set
              the emotional context of the experience right from the beginning.

        Another major addition was the ripple animation that appears when the
        audio plays. Initially, when the sound played, the interface felt too
        static, with the only change was the text being highlighted. I wanted
        the audio interaction to feel more alive and reflective of the project’s
        calm, zen-inspired theme. This so helped to enhancing overall user
        experience using the website. Making the website not only more immersive
        but more fun overall.

          <p style="margin-left: -1px">
            While creating this website I always thought that the sound itself
            reminded me of wind chimes and water drums, which led to the idea of
            mimicking a droplet hitting water. By adding ripples that expand and
            slowly fade away, I created a visual element that worked alongside
            the sound, turning the moment into both an audio and visual
            experience.

            Getting this right wasn’t easy. I went through multiple rounds of
            testing to nail the timing and randomness. I used CSS animations
            triggered through JavaScript and added &lt;math.random&gt; so the
            animations wouldn’t feel too repetitive, making it more like real
            water droplets. It took time to balance the speed, size, and
            fade-out so it didn’t feel too artificial. But once it clicked, it
            really brought the interaction to life and made the whole experience
            feel more complete and immersive.

            <p style="margin-left: -1px">
              Lastly, I added a focus state to the Play button after the user
              types. In the earlier version, people didn’t always realise they
              were supposed to click Play next. This made the interaction feel
              unclear and broke the flow. By making the Play button stand out
              more at that moment, I could guide users to the next step
              naturally, without adding extra instructions. It also ensured they
              experienced the ripple animation properly, which is a key part of
              the overall vibe I wanted to create.

        <h2>Reflection on Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Overall, these changes were less about reinventing the concept and
          more about refining the interaction and listening to how users
          actually experienced the site. Adding more visual cues improved
          usability, and bringing in the ripple animation deepened the sensory
          experience. Looking back, I’m glad I made these adjustments because
          they made the final piece feel more cohesive, intuitive, and true to
          the calm, immersive atmosphere I was aiming for from the start.

        This project was completed over the span of eight weeks, moving through
        several key stages:

            <h2>Planning & Conceptualisation <span>(Week 1)</span></h2>
            <p>
              The idea came to me quite organically, after a bit of
              doomscrolling, I remember a TikTok trend where users turned their
              names into audio pieces. That was when I found myself wondering,
              “What would my name sound like?” which then expanded into, “Could
              you create music through words?” This curiosity became the
              foundation of the project.
            </p>

              <button>link to tiktok.</button>
            </a>
            <p>
              During this stage, I sketched a rough structure of the website and
              started thinking about how the interactions would work, especially
              how I could use &lt;math.random&gt; to generate interesting
              outputs. This phase was quite fluid and imaginative, but it also
              helped set a clear direction in terms of concept for the following
              weeks.
            </p>

            <img src="images/Layout-1.png" alt="code-1" style="width: 440px" />

        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item right">
          <div class="content" id="week2content">
            <h2>Start of Coding <span>(Week 1–3)</span></h2>
            <p>
              This phase ended up taking much longer than I expected. Turning
              the concept into a playable prototype required figuring out how to
              make every letter, number, and symbol trigger a sound using
              Tone.js. I started by getting the text box interaction to work,
              allowing users to type and immediately hear their “composition".
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, I implemented the core buttons and their functionalities:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-top: -20px">
              <li>
                <h3>Generate</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: -0px; margin-top: -20px">
                  Using &lt;math.random&gt; to suggest random words.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Play</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: -0px; margin-top: -20px">
                  To string the inputs together into a single sound piece.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Reset</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: -0px; margin-top: -20px">
                  To give users a fresh canvas.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once these core functions worked, I added a karaoke-like text
              highlighting feature so users could follow along during playback.
              This feature was technically challenging and took more time than
              planned.
            </p>

            <img
              src="images/highlight-feature.png"
              alt="code-1"

            <h2>Sound & Style <span>(Week 3)</span></h2>
            <p>
              At this stage, I realised that my initial visual style didn’t
              match the audio experience. The sounds had a calming,
              windchime-like quality, but the interface looked too plain and
              disconnected. I went back to the drawing board and decided to lean
              into a zen and calming aesthetic.
            </p>

              src="images/reference-2.png"

            />
            <p class="subtext">Images taken from Pinterest</p>
            <p>
              Rather than changing the entire structure, I refined the colour
              palette to use greens, added textures, and made subtle adjustments
              that gave the interface more warmth and cohesion. This was a
              turning point, the experience started to feel more immersive and
              unified once the visuals and sounds aligned.
            </p>

        <div class="timeline-item right">
          <div class="content" id="week4content">
            <h2>User Testing <span>(Week 4)</span></h2>
            <p>
              User testing played a big role in refining the project. I focused
              on whether users felt the style matched the sound and interaction,
              and I received valuable feedback. This stage validated some of my
              decisions but also pointed out areas, ike button visibility and
              placeholder text, that needed improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was also a good reminder of how users interpret interfaces
              differently from how I imagined them as a designer. This feedback
              loop was crucial in shaping the final version.

            <h2>Improvements <span>(Week 5–7)</span></h2>
            <p>
              In the final stage, I focused on refining interactions, making the
              buttons more identifiable, adding ripple animations during
              playback, and polishing smaller UI elements. This is all mention
              earlier.

            <h2>Finalisation <span>(Week 8)</span></h2>
            <p>
              Looking back, the timeline overall loosely followed my initial
              plan, but there were several points, especially during coding and
              animation, where I underestimated the time needed. These
              challenges taught me a lot about scoping self-directed projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned that while the concept phase can feel fast and exciting,
              implementation almost always takes longer, and leaving buffer time
              for unexpected technical hurdles is essential.

      <h1 id="proudCon">Most Proud</h1>

      <p>
        I think what I’m most proud of is the overall journey of bringing this
        website to life. At the start, I didn’t have a clear direction, but
        through many small iterations, I was able to shape the concept and
        visual style into something that felt cohesive and intentional. This
        process was quite different from my previous projects, where the concept
        stayed fixed from the beginning. Initially, I imagined the site as a
        tool that simply turned text into audio. But as I worked on it, the
        visual direction evolved significantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m especially glad I didn’t lock myself into one visual style too
        early. Allowing myself to stay flexible meant I could adapt based on
        what the project needed at different stages. Shifting towards a calming,
        zen aesthetic opened up new design possibilities, such as the ripple
        animation, which helped create a more immersive atmosphere and tied the
        visual and audio elements together more seamlessly.

            On the technical side, I’m proud of how the sound design and
            animation came together. This was my first time designing something
            centred around sound, and it took a lot of experimentation with
            Tone.js to find and fine-tune the right tones to match my vision.
            The animation work also involved a lot of trial and error, and
            getting it to function smoothly was incredibly satisfying. Looking
            back, both the conceptual flexibility and technical problem-solving
            are aspects I’m genuinely proud of.

            The most challenging (and ironically, most rewarding) part was
            building the letter-tracking visual element. This feature required
            the most research, testing, and creative problem-solving. I had to
            think outside the box to get it working the way I imagined,
            including overlaying text and working around the limitations of the
            &lt;textarea&gt; element.
            <br /><br />
            I tried multiple methods before landing on a solution that felt

          Overall, I’m genuinely proud of this website and the process it took
          to create it. It wasn’t easy, there were moments of uncertainty,
          constant iteration, and technical roadblocks, but I’m glad I
          persevered and kept refining it.
          <br /><br />
          If I had more time, I’d love to expand the site by introducing
          different themes, each with its own background, colour palette, and
          matching soundscape, to give users more ways to shape their calming

          This project taught me a lot, both technically and creatively. I’ve
          gained a deeper understanding of how interaction, sound, and visual

          insights to future projects.
