      <p style="margin-top: -100px">
        My project explores the transformation of typing, a common, everyday
        computer interaction, into audio cues. Using
        <span style="font-weight: bold">novel input </span>techniques to convert
        text into sound. The concept was inspired by TikTok videos in which
        users generate unique sounds from their names. From there I began
        imagining what my own name would sound like and then expanded this into
        the broader design inquiry: “What will this text sound like?”
      </p>

      </a>

      <div class="sidebyside">
        <p class="left">
          I developed an interaction where users can type words and immediately
          hear corresponding sounds, effectively turning simple text into short,
          dynamic audio pieces. Because the project is primarily text-driven, I
          deliberately designed a minimalist and clean layout to ensure that
          sound remains the primary focus. I researched a variety of website
          styles, particularly those emphasizing typography and clarity, and
          initially planned to replicate a similarly structured aesthetic.

          />
          <p class="subtext" style="margin-top: -20px">

        <p class="right">
          However, during development, I realized that my initial design didn’t
          quite match the generated sounds. I began experimenting with both the
          visuals and the audio to make them feel more aligned. While exploring
          different options, I noticed that the audio started to resembled wind
          chimes, which inspired a shift toward a Zen-like visual style. I kept
          the layout minimal so the audio could guide the visual atmosphere.
          This approach ensured that the interaction stayed focused on the
          auditory experience rather than relying on symbols or complex
          graphics, creating a cohesive and conceptually consistent UI.

      <h1 id="techCon">Technical Conceptualisation</h1>
      <p style="margin-top: -100px">
        For the advanced techniques, I implemented a “generate” button using
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Math.random()</span>. When clicked, it
        selects a word at random from a predefined list, which fits naturally
        into the interaction and goes well with my desired interaction.

        <br />
        <br />
        The system’s core interactions, implemented using JavaScript and
        Tone.js, include:
      </p>

      <div class="sidebyside2">
        <div class="background">
          <h2 style="color: white">1. Sound While Typing</h2>
          <p>Each keys triggers a corresponding note that plays when typed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="background">
          <h2 style="color: white">2. Play Button Playback</h2>
          <p>Sequentially plays all letters that are typed in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="background">
          <h2 style="color: white">3. Visual Tracking of Letters</h2>
          <p>Highlights the current character being played in real time.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        To support these interactions, I mapped the keyboard so that each letter
        and symbol corresponded to a distinct note. Symbols such as periods or
        spaces were mapped to chords, expanding the musical possibilities.
        Uppercase letters were mapped as sharps of their lowercase equivalents,
        increasing the variety of sounds.
      </p>

      <div class="sidebyside" style="margin-top: 100px">
        <div class="left">
          <h2>Interaction 1: Sound While Typing</h2>
          <p style="margin-left: -1px">
            This interaction was implemented using an input event listener on
            the &lt;textarea&gt;. When the user types, Tone.js’s
            triggerAttackRelease method plays the corresponding note. While
            technically straightforward, this required mapping of characters to
            musical notes to ensure it was the right pitch, allowing the sound
            to fit better with the aesthetic of the page.

        <div class="right">
          <h2>Interaction 2: Play Button Playback</h2>
          <p style="margin-right: -1px">
            This interaction was implemented by iterating through all the
            characters in the text area and playing each one using
            triggerAttackRelease. As the code progresses, each character is read
            in sequence, triggering the corresponding note or chord based on the
            predefined mappings. This allows the text to be “sounded out” in
            real time, creating an audio piece made by letters and punucation.

      <h2 style="margin-top: 100px">
        Interaction 3: Visual Tracking of Letters
      </h2>

      <p>
        This interaction presented a significant technical challenge. The key
        difficulty was tracking individual letters within a &lt;textarea&gt; and
        updating their visual state to reflect the corresponding sound being
        played. Standard &lt;textarea&gt; elements do not allow per-character
        styling, so I implemented a layered solution: each typed character was
        mirrored as a separate &lt;span&gt; within an overlapping &lt;div&gt;.
        <br />
        This approach enabled real-time tracking and synchronisation of visual
        with audio playback.

        <br />
        Initially, I used a standard &lt;input&gt; field for typing and
        highlighting. However, this approach failed because input fields cannot
        style individual character, and styling only applies to the text. Hence,
        I tried the overlay option. With this implementation, each character
        could be individually highlighted as it played, providing clear visual
        feedback that reinforces the auditory experience.

      <h1 id="userTesting">User Testing</h1>
      <p>For user testing I asked 2 questions for feedback which were:</p>

      <div class="sidebyside2">
        <div class="background2">
          <h2 style="color: white; margin-bottom: -10px">Question 1</h2>
          <p>
            In what ways does the style and design of the interface feel calming
            (or not calming) to you? Does the sound match the experience?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="background2">
          <h2 style="color: white; margin-bottom: -10px">Question 2</h2>
          <p>
            How did you experience the interactions (typing, playback, reset)?
            What felt smooth, and what felt confusing?
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        I wanted to know more about whether the style matched the sound since
        that was one of my biggest concerns. The other was interaction, since I
        didn’t provide instructions and I needed to know if users could still
        understand what to do when they entered the website.
      </p>

      <div class="sidebyside" style="margin-top: 100px">
        <div class="left">
          <h2>Styling</h2>
          <p style="margin-left: -1px">
            After user testing, I got generally positive feedback, which
            reassured me that I was going in the right direction. For styling, I
            understood that users clearly picked up on my calming intentions,
            with one even describing the interface as “Zen.” This showed me that
            the green colour scheme, simple shapes, and layout were effective in
            creating the calm energy I wanted.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <img src="images/Feedback 1.png" alt="code-1" style="width: 750px" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="sidebyside" style="margin-top: 100px">
        <div class="left">
          <img src="images/Feedback 2.png" alt="code-1" style="width: 750px" />
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <h2>Interaction</h2>
          <p style="margin-right: -1px">
            For interactions, the feedback was more mixed but very useful. Some
            people noted that the interface was intuitive and smooth, while
            others pointed out issues such as the sound playing before pressing
            play, or confusion about the two play buttons. The biggest piece of
            feedback I found helpful was that the generate button didn’t look
            clickable, which caused some confusion. This is something I can
            improve by either changing the wording to “surprise me” or maybe
            adding a thin boarder around the button. I need to test it out to
            see what works the best.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Overall, the feedback confirmed that the calming style and matching
        sound design were successful, but I need to refine the clarity of
        certain interactions so that users immediately understand how to use the
        interface.

        <h1 class="left">In Conclusion...</h1>
        <p class="right">
          this project has taught me a great deal about working with Tone.js and
          designing interactions around sound. It challenged me to transform a
          simple idea into a full website experience and encouraged me to think
          creatively when solving technical challenges, such as the textarea
          highlight issue. Through this process, I developed a better
          understanding of how sound, visuals, and user interactions can work
          together to create an immersive and cohesive experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          Looking ahead, my next steps are to refine the website based on peer
          feedback, improving clarity and usability of the interface. I also aim
          to explore new interactive features, such as animating the background
          ripple in response to the sounds being played, which would enhance the
          immersive and calming atmosphere of the project.
