        <h1>Project Conceptualisation</h1>
        <p>
          My project explores the transformation of typing, a common, everyday
          computer interaction, into audio cues. Using novel input techniques to
          convert text into sound. The concept was inspired by TikTok videos in
          which users generate unique sounds from their names. From there I
          began imagining what my own name would sound like and then expanded
          this into the broader design inquiry: “What will this text sound
          like?”

          <br /><br />I developed an interaction where users can type words and
          immediately hear corresponding sounds, effectively turning simple text
          into short, dynamic audio pieces. Because the project is primarily
          text-driven, I deliberately designed a minimalist and clean layout to
          ensure that sound remains the primary focus. I researched a variety of
          website styles, particularly those emphasizing typography and clarity,
          and initially planned to replicate a similarly structured aesthetic.

          <br /><br />However, during development, I realized that my initial
          design didn’t quite match the generated sounds. I began experimenting
          with both the visuals and the audio to make them feel more aligned.
          While exploring different options, I noticed that the audio resembled
          wind chimes, which inspired a shift toward a Zen-like visual style. I
          kept the layout minimal so the audio could guide the visual
          atmosphere. This approach ensured that the interaction stayed focused
          on the auditory experience rather than relying on symbols or complex
          graphics, creating a cohesive and conceptually consistent UI.

        <h1>Technical Conceptualisation</h1>

        <p>
          For the advanced techniques, I implemented a “generate” button using
          Math.random(). When clicked, it selects a word at random from a
          predefined list, which fits naturally into the interaction and goes
          well with my desired interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system’s core interactions, implemented using JavaScript and
          Tone.js, include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Sound While Typing</strong> – each keystroke triggers a
            corresponding note.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Play Button Playback</strong> – sequentially plays all
            letters typed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual Tracking of Letters</strong> – highlights the current
            character being played in real time.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To support these interactions, I mapped the keyboard so that each
          letter and symbol corresponded to a distinct note. Symbols such as
          periods or spaces were mapped to chords, expanding the musical
          possibilities. Uppercase letters were mapped as sharps of their
          lowercase equivalents, increasing the variety of sounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Interaction 1: Sound While Typing</strong><br />
          This interaction was implemented using an input event listener on the
          &lt;textarea&gt;. When the user types, Tone.js’s
          <code>triggerAttackRelease</code> method plays the corresponding note.
          While technically straightforward, this required mapping of characters
          to musical notes to ensure the sound fit better with the page’s
          aesthetic.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Interaction 2: Play Button Playback</strong><br />
          This interaction was implemented by iterating through all the
          characters in the text area and playing each one using
          <code>triggerAttackRelease</code>. Each character is read in sequence,
          triggering the corresponding note or chord. This allows the text to be
          “sounded out” in real time while optionally highlighting the current
          character for visual feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Interaction 3: Visual Tracking of Letters</strong><br />
          This interaction presented a technical challenge. Standard
          &lt;textarea&gt; elements do not allow per-character styling, so I
          implemented a layered solution: each typed character was mirrored as a
          separate &lt;span&gt; within an overlapping &lt;div&gt;. This enabled
          real-time tracking and synchronization of visual with audio playback.
        </p>

        <p>
          Initially, I used a standard &lt;input&gt; field for typing and
          highlighting. However, this approach failed because input fields
          cannot style individual characters. Hence, I tried the overlay option.
          With this implementation, each character could be individually
          highlighted as it played, providing clear visual feedback that
          reinforces the auditory experience.
